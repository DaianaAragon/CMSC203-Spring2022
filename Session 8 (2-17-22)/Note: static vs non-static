// STATIC VS NON=STATIC

- When an attribute is defined as static, it only exists one copy of said attribute in the entire class.
  This means that a single copy of the static attribute is shared by all instances of the class.


            //  IMPORTANT!!!
- Non-static methods can access both static AND non-static attributes.

- Static methods CANNOT access non-static attributes.
